# Employee Performance Evaluation Expert System

This project is an **Expert System** designed to evaluate employee performance based on key metrics such as task completion, attendance, teamwork, and feedback. The system uses a rule-based approach to calculate a weighted score and classify performance into categories like "Excellent," "Good," "Average," or "Needs Improvement."

---

## Features

- **Rule-Based Evaluation**: Evaluates employee performance using predefined rules and weighted scoring.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built with **Flask** and **Bootstrap**.
- **Scalable Logic**: Teamwork and feedback scores are scaled to a 0-100 range for consistency.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures inputs are within valid ranges (e.g., task completion and attendance between 0-100, teamwork and feedback between 1-5).
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is mobile-friendly and works on all screen sizes.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core logic and backend.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application.
- **Bootstrap**: Front-end styling for a clean and responsive interface.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.

## Logic Overview

The evaluation logic is implemented in `expert_system.py`. It calculates a weighted score based on the following parameters:

- **Task Completion (40%)**
- **Attendance (20%)**
- **Teamwork (20%)**: Scaled from 1-5 to 0-100.
- **Feedback (20%)**: Scaled from 1-5 to 0-100.

The total score is classified into performance categories:

| Total Score | Performance Rating   |
|-------------|----------------------|
| â‰¥ 90        | Excellent            |
| â‰¥ 75        | Good                 |
| â‰¥ 50        | Average              |
| < 50        | Needs Improvement    |

## Example Test Cases

Here are some example inputs and their corresponding outputs:

| Task Completion | Attendance | Teamwork | Feedback | Performance Rating   |
|-----------------|------------|----------|----------|----------------------|
| 92              | 97         | 4        | 5        | Excellent            |
| 80              | 90         | 3        | 3        | Good                 |
| 60              | 75         | 2        | 2        | Average              |
| 40              | 60         | 1        | 1        | Needs Improvement    |
| 100             | 100        | 5        | 5        | Excellent            |
